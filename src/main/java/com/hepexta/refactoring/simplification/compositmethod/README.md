COMPOSE METHOD

You can’t rapidly understand a method’s logic.

`Transform the logic into a small number of intention-revealing steps at the same level of detail.`

Most refactorings to Composed Method involve applying Extract Method several times until the Composed Method does most (if not all) of its work via calls to other methods.
